We welcome contributions to the Sofya tool from the research community.  If you have a contribution please contact us
with a description.  We especially welcome any effort to make Sofya function with Java 8 and later versions of the SDK.
We also have considered using a different bytecode library, e.g. ASM, but we have not had the time.  Additional analyses
that offer new insights into dynamic code behavior are also of interest.
